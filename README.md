# Bike-rental-forecasting-
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
In the Kaggle problem on forecasting use of a city bikeshare system, our aim is to predict the number of bikes
that may get rented for the test data, after training a model on the train.csv file.
