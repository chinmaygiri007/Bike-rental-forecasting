# Bike-rental-forecasting
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
In the Kaggle problem on forecasting use of a city bikeshare system, our aim is to predict the number of bikes
that may get rented for the test data, after training a model on the train.csv file.


**Project**

1. train_BS & test_BS - These are two datasets collected during 2011 and 2012, when this all started. It contains the various attributes like datetime, season, holiday and etc. "train_BS.csv" helps us in training the model, whereas "test_BS" helps in testing.

2. Bike_Sharing_implementation.ipynb - This the python notebook, which contains the ML model. On which Exploratory data analysis, Model training, testing are performed.
